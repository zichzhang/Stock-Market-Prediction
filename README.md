### CONTEXT 
Since the advent of the stock market, people have been trying to predict the market, and reading 
into the technicality of the mysterious system, in hopes of making money. However, these people 
all came to a single conclusion, that the market is unpredictable. For our project, we wanted to 
see how close we can predict the 2017 stock prices of the S&P 500, using only past data from the 
years prior (2013-2016).  While seeming relatively trivial, we decided to figure out a way to fit 
an exponential to the stock data from scratch through an iterative process which is not as simple 
nor straightforward as it seems. 

### DESCRIPTION OF MODEL 
If we zoom out of the S&P 500 chart all the way to its beginnings in 1950, the overall trend of the graph is to the upside and forming something like an exponential 
function (Harwood). Within those years, there are periods of strong economic growth and 
economic crashes causing the S&P 500 to trace higher or lower, but the overall exponentially 
growing trend is what allows us to confidently use a computational approach to predict future 
stock prices of the S&P 500.
